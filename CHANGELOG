snowplow-fractribution 0.2.0 (2023-0X-XX)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This version migrates our models away from the `snowplow_incremental_materialization` and instead move to using the built-in `incremental` with an optimization applied on top. 

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
### Changes to materialization
To take advantage of the optimization we apply to the `incremental` materialization, users will need to add the following to their `dbt_project.yml` : 
```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
...
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt
    search_order: ['snowplow_utils', 'dbt']
```

For custom models please refer to the [snowplow utils migration guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/utils/#upgrading-to-0140) and the latest docs on [creating custom incremental models](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/dbt-custom-models/#incremental-models).

## Features
- Migrate from `get_cluster_by` and `get_partition_by` to `get_value_by_target_type`
- Migrate all models to use new materialization

## Docs
- Update readme

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-normalize version in your `packages.yml` file, and ensuring you have followed the above steps. You can read more in our [upgrade guide](https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/modeling-your-data/modeling-your-data-with-dbt/migration-guides/fractribution/#upgrading-to-0140)

snowplow-fractribution 0.2.0 (2023-02-24)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release adds support for Databricks and BigQuery. From now users are allowed to filter unwanted channels as well. Under the hood we added an integration testing suite and some automations with Github actions.

## Features
Add support for Databricks and BigQuery
Add release and pages actions (#5)
Allow user to filter unwanted channels (#3)
Add versioning for Docker

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
Variable names have changed (prefaced with `snowplow__`), please align the new ones found in the dbt_project.yml file and the ones defined in your own project's yml file that you used to overwrite the default values. Please note that
`snowplow__path_transforms` variable is a dictionary instead of an array and that the path transform names have also changed (e.g: `Exposure` -> `exposure_path`).

The scripts inside the utils folder also changed which need to be replaced. In case you used Docker, you can either pull the latest image: `docker pull snowplow/fractribution:latest` or the version number in line with the package: `docker pull snowplow/fractribution:0.2.0`.

Due to dependencies please be aware that the package requires dbt-core@1.3 as a minimum.

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-fractribution version in your `packages.yml` file as well as make the necessary changes highlighted in the Breaking Changes section.
