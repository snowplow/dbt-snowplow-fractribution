## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
Variable names have changed (prefaced with `snowplow__`), please align the new ones found in the dbt_project.yml file and the ones defined in your own project's yml file that you used to overwrite the default values. Please note that
`snowplow__path_transforms` variable is a dictionary instead of an array and that the path transform names have also changed (e.g: `Exposure` -> `exposure_path`).

The scripts inside the utils folder also changed which need to be replaced. In case you used Docker, you can either pull the latest image: `docker pull snowplow/fractribution:latest` or the version number in line with the package: `docker pull snowplow/fractribution:0.2.0`.

Due to dependencies please be aware that the package requires dbt-core@1.3 as a minimum.

## Upgrading
To upgrade bump the snowplow-fractribution version in your `packages.yml` file as well as make the necessary changes highlighted in the Breaking Changes section.
